# Cluedo Game 

SEI 36 - Project 1
Turn-based Game

# Technologies & Tools Used 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & Github

# How to Play the Game: 
- the idea of cluedo is go from room to room to eliminate people, places and weapons before you make a final guess of WHO, WHAT & WHERE
- roll dice to start game and you enter a room based on the roll. 
- on each turn, you can select any one suspect & any one weapon. 
- the suggestion will include the room you are in. 
- you can click the accuse button at any time and select a who, what, where to accuse. 
- Game ends once you click the check envelope button to check if your accusation was right!!

The game is deployed on Vercel & you can play the game here: https://cluedo.vercel.app/

# Approach & Process
Did some research on how the game was played but due to time constraints, I had to alter the game rules & game play quite a bit. 
I would have planned out the steps in more detail & follow the time schedule more diligently. With good planning, I could avoid giving myself undue stress since I underestimated the time it would take and the difficulties I would face. 


# What I learnt & What I would do differently -  
- Start small first & make sure the game code really works! 
- Make it a habit to console.log consistently so you know that if something went wrong, itâ€™s the last part you just added that is causing this bug
- Could bounce off ideas with people and 
- Try not to overcomplicate things 
- Once I have to repeat the codes, I should think about finding a more concise method.
- I re-wrote my code as my initial draft had many repetitive functions & in the proccess, i made my code more concise.

- Throughout this project, I became more fluent in using vanilla JavaScript.
